# Publishing DITA files to PDF with DITA2PDF

DITA2PDF is a method of publishing DITA files to the PDF output format. Briefly summarized, you write texts in Oxygen and you publish them via FrameMaker:

1. Write your content in Oxygen.
2. Install the ditafmx-plugin for FrameMaker.
3. Use the plug-in to import your Oxygen files into FrameMaker.

   The files will be transformed into FrameMaker files and a template \(including layout\) will be applied to the files.

4. If necessary, make some last-minute modifications to the text.

   **Note:** Things to watch out for:

   * Adjust the images to the right resolution.
   * Resize the tables.
   * Check if any spaces have disappeared \(this can happen next to inline images\).
   * Check if all conditional text is correct.
   * etc.

5. Publish the document to PDF.
