# Oxygen XML WebHelp Responsive

One of the outputs is **DITA Map Webhelp Responsive** from Oxygen XML. The name derives from the systemâ€™s ability to adapt to any device or screen size to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

In Oxygen XML there are a variety of different templates from which you can choose \(in the Edit DITA scenario window\) to create your responsive online help.

**Note:** You also have the possibility to use your own custom publishing template.

The templates exist in two versions:

* The first-level topics in tiles.
* The first- and second-level topics as a tree.
