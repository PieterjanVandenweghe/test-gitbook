# Re-using DITA maps

You can re-use entire DITA maps in your structure. To create re-usable DITA maps, create and organize topics into submaps that document common features or user tasks.

Even if you have only one user guide, you can create one DITA map for installation topics, one DITA map for security topics, and one DITA map for configuration topics.
