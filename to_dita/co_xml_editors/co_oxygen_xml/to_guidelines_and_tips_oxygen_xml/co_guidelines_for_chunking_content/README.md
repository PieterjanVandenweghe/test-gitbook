# Guidelines for chunking content

## Include enough information

Although a topic should only answer a single question, it should still contain enough information to make sense on its own. Which info the topic has to contain depends on the information type:

| Information type | Has to include enough info to |
| :--- | :--- |
| Task topic | Begin and complete a particular task |
| Concept topic | Grasp a particular concept |
| Reference topic | Look up and understand particular information |

**Note:** Topics often include related content. A particular task topic can, for example, use concepts that are described in separate concept topics. As a result, it is impossible to make each topic completely autonomous. You can solve that problem by adding related links to your topic \(using the `related-links` element\); the body part of your topic remains discrete, while you still guide the user to the related information.

## Mind Miller's Law \(7±2\)

According to Miller’s law, an average person can only hold 7±2 objects in working memory. You should keep in mind this law when chunking content into topics. For instance, if you are writing a task topic and notice that it contains over ten steps, try to reduce the number of steps. You can do this by:

* grouping short steps.

  **Note:** For example, the following steps:

  1. Choose **File**
  2. Choose **New**
  3. Choose **Topic**

     can be grouped into: Choose **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Topic**.

* splitting your task into two or more subtasks.

  **Note:** You can then include an overview topic that describes the entire process and refers to the different steps \(subtasks\) of that process.

The same goes for other lists. If you have a list of twenty safety instructions, for example, you can group the related instructions in separate sections. You can then also include a specific title for each group of safety instructions, to better guide the users.

## Include enough information

The first challenge in topic-based authoring is chunking your content into discrete topics. It can be hard to determine the ideal length of a topic: it should be short enough to answer a single question yet still include enough information to stand on its own. Additionally, you should also keep in mind Miller’s law when chunking your content.
