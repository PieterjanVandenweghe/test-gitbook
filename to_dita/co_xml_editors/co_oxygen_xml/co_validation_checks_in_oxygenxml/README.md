# Detecting and fixing style guide errors in Oxygen XML

Oxygen XML supports Schematron and Schematron QuickFix which makes it possible to check your business rules against your DITA content. You can set-up this check in several ways:

* [Checking the content while you are writing](ta_adding_a_validation_check_to_your_custom_framework.md).
* [Checking the content after you wrote the content](ta_configuring_a_validation_scenario.md).

In both scenarios you get messages \(information, warning, error\) which you can fix if needed. These messages will not prevent you to publish your content in any way, but can help to write consistent and efficient.
