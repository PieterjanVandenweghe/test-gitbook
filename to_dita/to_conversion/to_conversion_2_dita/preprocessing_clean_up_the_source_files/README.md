# Step 1: Preprocessing â€” Clean up the source files

The source files \(Word or FrameMaker\) contain pieces of content which you need to check and fix first to make the conversion run as smoothly as possible. Examples include:

* Consistent styling and formatting
* Graphics
* Cross-references
* Special characters
* Conditional text settings

These checks and fixes are explained in detail in the topics in this section.
