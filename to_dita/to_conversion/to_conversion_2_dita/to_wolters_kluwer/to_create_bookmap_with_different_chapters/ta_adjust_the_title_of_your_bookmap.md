# Adjust the title of your BOOKMAP

When your bookmap is opened in the **DITA Maps Manager**, you will notice that it is merely called “bookmap”.

1. To change the title of your bookmap:
2. Open your bookmap by double-clicking it in the **DITA Maps Manager**.
3. Write the name of your document within the `mainbooktitle` tags of your opened bookmap file.

   **Note:** You don't have to add "Wolters Kluwer" to the main title of the document. This is added automatically when the bookmap is published to PDF using the custom WKFS Miramo template.
