# General folder structure for each type of WKFS software

For each type of WKFS software \(for example APRA, MAS610, AnaCredit â€¦\), we create a general folder in the WKFS Documentation Initiative - Documents folder in OneDrive. Within this folder, the following four folders are always created:

* 00\_original\_documentation: this folder contains all the original input documents that we receive from WKFS.
* 01\_preparation\_conversion: this folder contains the "prepped" input documents: in other words, the WKFS input documents that have been adjusted to contain the correct Word Styles \(to allow a smooth automatic conversion from Word to DITA\).
* 02\_conversion: this folder contains all the files and folders that are necessary for or created during the conversion process.
* 03\_dita: this folder contains all DITA files and DITAMAPS that are created during and edited after the conversion process.
