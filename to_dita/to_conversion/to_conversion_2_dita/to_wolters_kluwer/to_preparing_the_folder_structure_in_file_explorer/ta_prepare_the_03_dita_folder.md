# Prepare the 03\_dita folder

1. Copy the folder containing your DITA and DITAMAP files \(in this case: sgmas\_ug\) from the 02\_conversion folder to the 03\_dita folder in your software folder \( in this case: MAS610\).
2. Give the folder in the 03\_dita folder a more general name \(e.g. sgmas\) and delete all irrelevant INI, TXT, MIF, JPG, PNG â€¦ files from this folder.

   **Note:** The folder should only contain DITA and DITAMAP files at this point.

3. Go to the 03\_dita folder of a previously converted manual, and:
   1. copy the \_glossary, \_conventions and \_subject\_scheme folders to your new 03\_dita folder.
   2. copy the \_warehouse folder to the folder containing your DITA files \(in this case: sgmas\) in your new 03\_dita folder.
   3. copy the keys ditamap as well as the \_external\_links.ditamap to the folder containing your DITA files \(in this case: sgmas\) in your new 03\_dita folder.
4. Create a new \_graphics folder within the folder that contains your DITA files.

   **Note:** See section [Extract the necessary images from the original Word DOCX file](ta_extract_the_necessary_images_from_the_original_word_docx_file.md) to fill this \_graphics folder with all the images that are used in the original Word DOCX file.
