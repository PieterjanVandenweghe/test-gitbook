# Adding the correct metadata

Each topic includes a `prolog` element. Some of the info in the prolog is added while converting the files to DITA. Other info needs to be added with the refactoring option in OxygenXML Editor.

These attributes need to be completed:

* `copyrholder`
* `copyryear`
* `category`
* `prodname`
