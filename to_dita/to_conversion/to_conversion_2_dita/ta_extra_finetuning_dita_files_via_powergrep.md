   Now you have selected the entire contents of this folder.

2. Open the **Library** tab, select the following tasks one by one and Select **Replace**:
   * **General conversion 05: Href Filename with \#ID.dita replaced by filename**
   * **General conversion 06: remove proportional collwidth after mif2go conversion**
