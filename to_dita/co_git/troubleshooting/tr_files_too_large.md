# Files too large

## Condition

When you try to upload a file larger than 100 MB you get the following error message:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/git-file-too-large.png)

## Cause

GitHub only allows files &lt; 100 MB to be pushed to the cloud.

It's only possible to upload larger files when you use an external add-on to GitHub. At Flow bv we currently don't have this add-on.
