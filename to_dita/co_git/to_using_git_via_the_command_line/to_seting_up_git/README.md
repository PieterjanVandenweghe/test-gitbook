# Setting up Git

## Advantages of the command line

Using Git via the command line offers a number of advantages:

* Full control over the actions you initiate \(a UI tool runs operations behind the scenes\)
* No bugs from UI tools
* Universal configuration language

## Git command line tools

* Command Prompt: the standard command line tool offered by Windows
* [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/): command line specifically designed for Git, has a built-in editor to write commit messages
