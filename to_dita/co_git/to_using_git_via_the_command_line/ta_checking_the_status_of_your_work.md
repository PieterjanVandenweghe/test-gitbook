# Checking the status of your work

To check the changes you have made since the last commit on your branch, do the following:

1. Type `git status`.
2. Press Enter.

   The status of the current active branch is shown.

   In the example above, new files have been created. These additions have already been [staged](co_staging_and_committing_changes/ta_staging_changes.md) and are ready to be [committed](co_staging_and_committing_changes/ta_committing_changes.md). One other newly created file has not been staged yet.

   In the example above, all changes have been committed, but there are still a number of commits to be [pushed](ta_pushing_a_commit.md) to the remote repository.
