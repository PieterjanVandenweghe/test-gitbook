# Creating a local Git repository

Before you can create a local Git repository, you have to [open the destination folder](ta_opening_a_destination_folder/) \(the folder where you want to work locally\) in your command line tool.

After this, you typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

* You can [clone](ta_opening_a_destination_folder/ta_cloning_an_existing_repository.md) an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
* You can take a [local directory](ta_opening_a_destination_folder/ta_initializing_a_local_folder.md) that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository.
