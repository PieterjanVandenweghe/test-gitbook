# Combining staging, committing and commit messages

You can stage, commit and include commit messages separately, but you can also combine them into one command.

1. Type one of the following:
   * `git commit -a`: Automatically stage all changes and commit them.
   * `git commit -m 'commit message'`: Commit all staged changes and include the commit message.
   * `git commit -a -m 'commit message'`: Automatically stage all changes, commit them and include a commit message.
2. Press Enter.
