# Downloading a GitHub Desktopversion

All GitHub files are stored in the cloud on the Flow bv GitHub organization page. When you write documentation for customers, you need to work on a local copy of the files and synchronize the files on a regular base to the cloud. You can do this with the GitHub Desktop tool. There are also other syncing tools available, but we use GitHub Desktop for now .

**Note:**

You use GitHub Desktop only to synchronize the files. This tool doesn't resolve potential conflicts but is linked to a tool that resolves the conflicts.

1. Go to the [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/) homepage.
2. Choose **Download for Windows**.
3. Double-click the GitHubDesktopSetup.exe file in your default Downloads folder in Windows Explorer.
4. In the Welcome to GitHub Desktop pane, choose **Sign in to Github.com**.
5. Complete your personal settings and choose **Sign in**.
6. Choose **Continue** in the Configure Git pane.

   **Note:** It's not necessary to change the email address.

7. Choose whether you want to send usage stats in the **Make GitHub Desktop better** pane.
8. Choose **Finish**.

You have now installed GitHub Desktop and you get an overview of all the repositories you are currently contributing to.
