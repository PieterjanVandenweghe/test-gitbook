* Choose **Open Githubdesktop.exe**.

  GitHub Desktop opens on your computer and shows the **Clone a repository** windows with the repository URL already added .

* Choose a **Local path** to store the file on your computer.

  **Tip:** Use a path with not too many subfolders. This could create problems uploading files at a later stage since the path length of a file can't be &gt; 256 characters on Windows.

The repository is ready to use on your computer.
