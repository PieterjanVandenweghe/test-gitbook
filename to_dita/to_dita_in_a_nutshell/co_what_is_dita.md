# What is DITA?

## Definition

DITA is an open standard to structure documentation and is therefore often used in technical writing.

It stands for Darwin Information Typing Architecture.

* **Darwin**

  A set of information models that can evolve and be specialized to account for the client's particular authoring and publishing needs.

* **Information Typing**

  Content is organized in chunks of information called "topics" and topics are categorized by the type of information they contain:

  * task
  * concept
  * reference
  * \(or other types of information\)

    See also: [What is an information type](co_what_is_an_information_type.md)

* **Architecture**

  A set of standardized, open-source, well-documented information models for various types of content

## History

DITA was originally developed by IBM but since 2005 it is defined and maintained by OASIS, a non-profit consortium comprised of members from the technology industry, users and influencers.

## Features

* [Re-use](../to_automation_of_documentation_processes/co_why_re_use_content.md)
  * [Single sourcing](../to_automation_of_documentation_processes/co_single_sourcing.md) \(content â†” context\)
  * [Multi-channel publishing](../to_automation_of_documentation_processes/co_multi_channel_publishing/) \(write content once, publish to multiple outputs\)
* Collaboration with other authors
* [Minimalism](../../co_structured_authoring/to_best_practices_of_structured_authoring/co_minimalism.md)
* [Structured authoring](../../co_structured_authoring/)
* Intelligent content
* [Conditional content](../to_conditional_processing/co_what_is_conditional_processing.md)
* Writing for translation

DITA and structured authoring are closely related. The first three DITA features are also structured authoring features.
