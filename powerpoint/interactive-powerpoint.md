# Interactive PowerPoint

There is a new way of making presentations. With Office Mix, a free add-in for PowerPoint, you can now make interactive videos. The Office Mix adds a tab to the PowerPoint ribbon, via which you can record video and audio, add screenshots, polls, quizzes or flash demonstrations, and export and publish videos.

The add-in is free and only requires you already have PowerPoint 2013 installed.
