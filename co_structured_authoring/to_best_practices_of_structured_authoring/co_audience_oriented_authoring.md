# Audience-oriented authoring

Know who you are writing for and keep your readers in mind when putting text to paper. Continually ask yourself: is this piece of information relevant for my readers?

You might want to work with layers of complexity through conditionalized text.

* beginners vs. advanced users
* end users vs. administrators

Audience-oriented writing is also called user-oriented writing or profiling.
