# Staging and committing changes

After editing files, you have to stage or approve the changes you have made. You can [stage changes](ta_staging_changes.html) in a number of ways, depending on which files you want to stage. After you have staged all changes you want to include, you can [commit](ta_committing_changes.html) them. When you commit changes, you always have to describe the changes in a commit message.

However, you can also combine staging, committing and adding a message through [shortcuts](ta_combining_staging__committing_and_commit_messages.html).
