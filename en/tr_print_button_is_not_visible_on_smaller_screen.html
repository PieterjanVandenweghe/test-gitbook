# Print button is not visible on smaller screen

## Condition

The print button is by default shown on the webhelp responsive on larger screen. However, on smaller devices the button disappears.

## Cause

The Bootstrap template is made in such a way that the button is invisible.

## Remedy

1.  Open the custom CSS file.

2.  Add the following CSS code

    ```
    wh_print_link {
    display: inline-block !important;
    }
    ```
