# Git at Flow

## Git vs. GitHub

Git is an open-source project that manages version control, while GitHub is the cloud-based platform that is build on top of Git and which makes it possible to collaborate or to automate workflows. GitHub is not for free when you use it in an organization and you want to keep your content hidden for people outside your organization.

## GitHub: Flow's default version and management tool

Flow bv uses GitHub as the default version and management tool for:

-   DITA projects from customers
-   Custom DITA-OT plug-ins

GitHub allows us to keep track of versions and restore if necessary. Everyone can work on a local copy and synchronize the files to the cloud whenever you want. It makes it easy to collaborate with colleagues without the fear of losing data.

Flow bv has its own [team page on GitHub](https://github.com/Flow-Technical-Communication/) with a limited number of members. Depending on the number of projects we can always add more members, but for now it's possible you will not always have access to all repositories.
