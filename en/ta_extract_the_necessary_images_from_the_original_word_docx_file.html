# Extract the necessary images from the original Word DOCX file

1.  Make a copy of the Word file from which you would like to extract the images \(e.g. test.docx\) and place it on your desktop for example.

2.  Click on the name of the document to rename it, and add the .zip extension to the original file name:test.docx.zip.

    A pop-up window with the following message appears: If you change a file name extension, the file might become unusable. Are you sure you want to change it?

3.  Select **Yes**.

    The Word file icon will change to the icon of a compressed ZIP folder.

4.  Double-click the ZIP folder to open it.

5.  Open the word folder and then the media folder.

6.  Copy all the images in this media folder to the \_graphics folder within the folder that contains all your DITA files \(located in the 03\_dita folder\).

    **Tip:** Use Snagit to crop or adjust the size of these images, if necessary.
