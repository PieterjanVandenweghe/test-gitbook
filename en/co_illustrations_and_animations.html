# Illustrations and animations

Add illustrations and animations wherever you can, but:

-   Avoid screenshots:
    -   you have to check them for every new release.
    -   they often do not provide added value.
-   Avoid text in illustrations:
    -   they ask more time to update.
    -   generally the text cannot be translated.
