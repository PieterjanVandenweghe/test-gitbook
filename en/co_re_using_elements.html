# Re-using elements

On the smallest scale, you can reference a single word or phrase. This should be done with care, however, as conreffing these can lead to issues such as ungrammatical sentences. To avoid any issues, it is safest to stick to fixed nouns, names and phrases that are unlikely to be modified by grammar, such as:

|Commonly re-used elements|Examples|
|-------------------------|--------|
|`cite`|Titles of books|
|`filepath`|File, directory or path names|
|`keyword`|Product names, model numbers|
|`menucascade` and `uicontrol`|Interface buttons, menus, check boxes, tabs|
|`wintitle`|Names of windows, panels, pages or dialog boxes|

On a larger scale, commonly referenced elements include:

-   Lists
-   Steps
-   Tables
-   Sentences
-   Paragraphs
