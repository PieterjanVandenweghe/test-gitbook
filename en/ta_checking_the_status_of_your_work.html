2.  Press Enter.

    The status of the current active branch is shown.

    In the example above, new files have been created. These additions have already been [staged](ta_staging_changes.html) and are ready to be [committed](ta_committing_changes.html). One other newly created file has not been staged yet.

    In the example above, all changes have been committed, but there are still a number of commits to be [pushed](ta_pushing_a_commit.html) to the remote repository.
