# Displaying topic titles instead of file names in a DITAMAP file

If you open a ditamap \(or bookmap\) in the **Author** mode in Oxygen, you will instantly notice that all the `topicref` elements are by default displayed according to their file name.

1.  To change the file names of `topicref` elements in a .DITAMAP file to their corresponding topic titles, proceed as follows:
2.  Select the **Styles** button in the toolbar: ![](../_media/graphics/styles_button.png).

3.  In the selection menu that appears, select the option **+ Show topic titles**.

    **Tip:** Another useful option in the **Styles** selection menu is **+ Edit topicref attributes inplace** which allows you to adjust the attributes specific to each topic within the ditamap in which these topics are referenced.
