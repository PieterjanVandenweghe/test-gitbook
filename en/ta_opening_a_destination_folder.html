# Opening a destination folder

1.  Type `cd <url>`.

    **Note:** Use forward slashes.

    **Note:** Make sure that the path includes the folder where the Git README.md is located. That is the folder you have initialised as a repository. For example, if you just type in `cd C:/Git/ngdata19001`, the tool will not recognize the repository because you chose product-documentation as the repository.

2.  Press Enter.

    The folder is opened. You can now clone a remote repository or use this folder as a local repository.
