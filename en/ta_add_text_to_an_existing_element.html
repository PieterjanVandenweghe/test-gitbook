# Add text to an existing element

Make sure to comment out all topics or chapters that do not need the metadata:

-   Glossary

-   All links in the frontmatter.


You run this procedure when the element is already present in the topic, but without content.

1.  Open the DITAMAP in the **Text** mode in the OxygenXML editor.

2.  Select all topics or DITAMAP files that do not need the metadata, right-click and choose **Toggle comment!**.

3.  Right-click on the DITAMAP file and choose **Refactoring** \> **Replace element with XML content**.

4.  Add the correct target element with Xpath in **Target elements \(Xpath\):**.

    //prolog//category

5.  Add the correct text to be added in **XML Fragment:**.

6.  Choose **Next**.

7.  Choose the **Current DITA map hierarchy** option in **Scope**.

8.  Choose **Preview**.

9.  Preview the result and do one of the following:

    -   Choose **Finish** is the preview is what you need.
    -   Choose **Back** is the preview is not what you need and go back to step [4](#step_j5d_5bp_jkb).

Open the DITAMAP file again in the editor and undo the commenting out.
