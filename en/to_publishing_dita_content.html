# Publishing DITA content in Oxygen XML

The Oxygen XML editors work with a build-in version of the DITA-OT. This is the standard DITA Open Toolkit completed with extra Oxygen XML plug-ins and patches. You can add custom plug-ins to the build-in version of DITA-OT at any time, but you will have to repeat this each time you install a new version of your editor.

You can also work with your own version of the DITA-OT when you change the standard preferences in Oxygen XML. Working your own version of the DITA-OT is useful when you collaborate and want to be sure that everyone works with the same version of the DITA-OT and the plug-ins.
