# What is DITA?

## Definition

DITA is an open standard to structure documentation and is therefore often used in technical writing.

It stands for Darwin Information Typing Architecture.

-   **Darwin**

    A set of information models that can evolve and be specialized to account for the client's particular authoring and publishing needs.

-   **Information Typing**

    Content is organized in chunks of information called "topics" and topics are categorized by the type of information they contain:

    -   task
    -   concept
    -   reference
    -   \(or other types of information\)
    See also: [What is an information type](co_what_is_an_information_type.html)

-   **Architecture**

    A set of standardized, open-source, well-documented information models for various types of content


## History

DITA was originally developed by IBM but since 2005 it is defined and maintained by OASIS, a non-profit consortium comprised of members from the technology industry, users and influencers.

## Features

-   [Re-use](co_why_re_use_content.html)
    -   [Single sourcing](co_single_sourcing.html) \(content â†” context\)
    -   [Multi-channel publishing](co_multi_channel_publishing.html) \(write content once, publish to multiple outputs\)
-   Collaboration with other authors
-   [Minimalism](co_minimalism.html)
-   [Structured authoring](co_structured_authoring.html)
-   Intelligent content
-   [Conditional content](co_what_is_conditional_processing.html)
-   Writing for translation

DITA and structured authoring are closely related. The first three DITA features are also structured authoring features.
