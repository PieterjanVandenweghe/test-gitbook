# Add the glossary term to the glossary map

Your publication needs to contain a glossary map. If this is not the case yet, add a ditamap to your publication.

**Note:** You can give this ditamap any name you like, but for clarity’s sake, we suggest you call it \_Glossary.

1.  Open the \_Glossary ditamap in the **DITA Maps Manager**.

2.  Right-click the \_Glossary ditamap and select **Append child** \> **Glossary Reference…**.

3.  Select your newly created glossentry topic.

4.  Click **Insert and close**.

    Oxygen adds the topic to the \_Glossary ditamap as a `glossref` element but gives an error message that the `glossref` element needs a key.

5.  Open the publication or the \_Glossary ditamap in the Author window.

6.  Select the newly added `glossref` element.

7.  Fill out its `@keys` attribute in the Attributes window.

    You can give this `@keys` attribute any name you like, but for clarity’s sake, we suggest you give it the same name as its `glossterm` or title.

8.  Save your changes.
