# What is a DITA map

A DITA map is a collection of [topics](co_what_is_a_topic.html) assembled into a sequence and hierarchy.

## Description

DITA maps are files with the extension .ditamap. Unlike topics, DITA maps shouldn’t contain any content of their own. Instead, they contain references to the content and provide a structure for these references. In this sense, you can best compare a DITA map to an outline that describes the hierarchy and the order of its topics.

## Hierarchy and nesting

DITA maps contain the structure of your topic references. This structure resembles a table of contents and helps your reader locate the required information. To create a meaningful structure, you can group relevant topics together and nest them under a topic grouping or a . The head topic is referred to as the ‘parent topic’ and the nested topics underneath it as its ‘child topics’. The relationship between the child topics is defined as ‘siblings’.
