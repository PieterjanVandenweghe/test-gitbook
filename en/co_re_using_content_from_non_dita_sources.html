# Re-using content from non-DITA sources

You can re-use existing content such as product codes and external sources by automatically pulling it into your DITA topics. For example, instead of writing a programming reference guide from scratch, you might pull comments from the software code and use those comments in your DITA topics.

Because DITA is a semantic tagging language, it can easily map non-DITA content to the proper DITA elements and insert the content in the correct location in your DITA topics.
