# Responsive online help

One of the outputs you can select in Oxygen XML is **DITA Map Webhelp Responsive**. The name derives from the systemâ€™s ability to adapt to any device or screen size to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

There are a variety of different templates from which you can choose \(in the Edit DITA scenario window\) to create your responsive online help.

**Note:** You also have the possibility to use your own custom publishing template.

The templates exist in two versions:

-   The first-level topics in tiles.
-   The first- and second-level topics as a tree.
