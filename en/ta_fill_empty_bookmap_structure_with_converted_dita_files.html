# Fill empty BOOKMAP structure with converted DITA files

After you have created a new ditamap for each chapter of your document \(in your bookmap\), make sure that the following files are opened in the **DITA Maps Manager**:

-   original \(automatically converted\) ditamap of your document

-   your bookmap


1.  For each individual chapter of your document, open the corresponding ditamap that you have recently created in the **DITA Maps Manager**.

2.  Drag the chapter topic \(along with all its child topics, if any\) from the \(automatically converted\) ditamap to the ditamap that you have just opened in the **DITA Maps Manager**.

    Drag the co\_workflow\_ug.dita file from the \(automatically converted\) sgmas\_ug.ditamap to the new \_workflow\_ug.ditamap belonging to your \_\_sgmas\_work\_flow\_and\_user\_guide.bookmap.ditamap.

3.  Save the adjustment you have made by selecting the Save icon in the **DITA Maps Manager** pane.

4.  Repeat this process for every chapter of the document that you are converting.
