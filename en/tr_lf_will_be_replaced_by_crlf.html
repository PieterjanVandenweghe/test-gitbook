## Condition

You get the error message `warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF` in a certain file when you want push the files to the cloud.

## Cause

These messages are due to incorrect default value of `core.autocrlf` on Windows. The concept of `autocrlf` is to handle the line endings transparently.

## Remedy

1.  Open the local folder of your GitHub repository in Windows Explorer.

2.  Open the config file in .git subfolder with a text editor like NotePad++.

3.  Add the code `autocrlf = false` in the `[core]` section.
