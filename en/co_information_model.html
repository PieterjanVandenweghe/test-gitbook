# What is an information model

An information model is a formal description of the structure and the structural components of which your information product consists.

|structure|the combination of the components’ order and hierarchy|
|structural component|title, warning, table, illustration, \(un\)ordered list …|
|information product|this can be a “document” such as a manual or a work instruction, but it can be an online help as well, or an intranet system or data base.|

An information model defines rules on how to structure the content. These rules need to be logical and make sense, so writers can easily learn and apply them. Some writing applications can validate these rules to enforce consistency. Validation greatly facilitates the writer’s task.
