# Detecting and fixing errors with Quick Fixes

Oxygen XML now has *quick fixes*. Quick fixes can help you quickly check if content adheres to the so-called *business rules*. These are rules for writing and structuring content, much like the rules you can find in style guides.

Quick fixes could work as follows:

1.  Someone \(for instance, an Information Architect\) writes business rules.

    **Note:** For example: "A semicolon cannot be used at the end of a list.“

2.  An XML-specialist turns the business rule into a *Schematron pattern*.
3.  This schematron pattern can be used to automatically detect instances in which a technical writer has not adhered to \(one of\) the predefined business rules. The technical writer can then quickly find excerpts that don’t match the business rules and instantly correct them by clicking on the light bulb that appears before the problem in question.
