# Creating a local Git repository

Before you can create a local Git repository, you have to [open the destination folder](ta_opening_a_destination_folder.html) \(the folder where you want to work locally\) in your command line tool.

After this, you typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:

-   You can [clone](ta_cloning_an_existing_repository.html) an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
-   You can take a [local directory](ta_initializing_a_local_folder.html) that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository.
