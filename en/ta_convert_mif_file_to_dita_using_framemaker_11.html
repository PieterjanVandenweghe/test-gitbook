# Convert MIF file to DITA using FrameMaker 11

1.  Create a new folder in the 02\_conversion folder.

    Example of folder name: sgmas\_ug \(user guide of the Singapore MAS documentation\)

2.  Go to the 02\_conversion folder of a manual that has previously been converted, and copy the 5 INI files within this folder to the folder you have just created.

    **Note:** If you open the \_m2dita.ini file, you can see how the Word styles have been mapped onto the various DITA elements.

3.  Open FrameMaker 11.

4.  Select **File** \> **Open …**, select the recently created MIF file and choose **Open**.

5.  Select **File** \> **Set Up Mif2Go Export…**.

6.  In the Choose Project window that opens:

    1.  Adjust the **Name** so it is not too long or complicated.

    2.  In the **Path** text field: select the path of the folder that you have just created within the 02\_conversion folder \(the sgmas\_ug folder in this case\).

    3.  In the **Format** text field: select **DITA**.

    4.  Select **OK**.

    The MIF file will be converted to DITA and all DITA and DITAMAP files will be saved in the sgmas\_ug folder.
