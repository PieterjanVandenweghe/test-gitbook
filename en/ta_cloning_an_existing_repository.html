# Cloning an existing remote repository

If you want to get a copy of an existing remote Git repository — for example, a project on GitHub, do the following:

1.  Type `git clone <url>`.

    `$ git clone https://github.com/Flow-Technical-Communication/webhelp.git`

    **Note:** If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than `libgit2`, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument: `$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit`.

2.  Press **Enter**.
