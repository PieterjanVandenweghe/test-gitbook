# DITA specialization

DITA specialization is the mechanism to extend the standard DITA semantics to your needs. This way you can enrich your content with the semantics that are valuable for your company. There are different kind of specializations:

-   Add extra elements and attributes to existing domains.
-   Add extra conditional formatting attributes.
-   Create new domains and elements.
