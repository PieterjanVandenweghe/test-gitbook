# Downloading Atom text editor

Atom is a text editor that will help to resolve [GitHub](https://github.com/) conflicts. By default, the tool is more than only a text editor to resolve conflicts, but for now we'll use it for this particular purpose only.

1.  Go to the [Atom](https://atom.io/) download page.

2.  Choose **Download**.

    The AtomSetup.exe is downloaded to a folder of your choice.

3.  Double-click the AtomSetup.exe to start the installer.

    Atom will start as soon as it has been installed.

4.  Quit Atom.

5.  Restart your computer.

    Yes, restarting your computer is necessary to be able to [set Atom as default text editor for GitHub desktop](ta_setting_atom_as_default_editor_for_github_desktop.html) .
