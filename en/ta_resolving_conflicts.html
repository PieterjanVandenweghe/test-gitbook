This procedure assumes you installed Atom as text editor for GitHub Desktop.

You get the following error message when you try to upload a committed file with a conflict to the cloud:

**Note:** You see a list of files when there are conflicts in more than 1 file.

1.  Choose **Open in Atom**.

    You get an overview of the conflict in Atom.

2.  Do one of the following:

    -   Choose **Use me \(our changes\)** to accept your change as final change.
    -   Choose **Use me \(their changes\)** to accept the changes from the collaborator.
3.  Save the file and switch to GitHub Desktop.

    The Resolve conflicts window shows **No conflicts remaining** for the updated file.
