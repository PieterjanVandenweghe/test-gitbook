# Creating a manifest file

The manifest file tells your browser about the progressive web app and how it should be installed when used on user's desktop or webapp. A manifest file includes:

-   The app name.
-   The icons the app should use.
-   The URL that should be opened when the app is launched.

The manifest file is added to the root folder of your website.

```
