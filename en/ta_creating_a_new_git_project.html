# Creating a new Git project

You need to have your personal GitHub account and be part of the Flow Technical Communication team on GitHub to create a new repository.

In this topic you create a new GitHub repository for DITA projects based on the DITA custom framework from Flow bv.

1.  Go to the Flow bv [GitHub team page](https://github.com/Flow-Technical-Communication/).

2.  Click the **New** button.

3.  Choose Flow-Technical-Communication/Template-folder-structure as **Repository template**.

4.  Give a proper name to your repository in the **Repository name** input field.

    We use the customer name as repository name.

5.  Optionally add a description.

6.  Tick the **Private** button.

7.  Click **Create repository.**

    Your new repository is created and opened.

8.  Create a new branch in the new repository by clicking on **Branch:master** and adding writing in the input field. Click the **Enter** button to confirm.

You created a new private GitHub repository which is only accessible for the Flow team members with a branch to start writing.

Personalize the general settings in the folder structure and Oxygen XML custom framework.
