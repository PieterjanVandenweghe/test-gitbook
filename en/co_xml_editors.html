# XML editors

Since DITA is an open standard, it can of course be edited from any text editor such as Notepad++ or other text editing tools. However, most editing tools don’t have support for the specific DITA standard. For this you need a DITA authoring tool. The following tools are used within our company:

## Technical editors

These editors give you the ability to ‘hide’ the tags while writing, allowing you to focus on the content while still writing structured XML documents.

-   [Adobe FrameMaker](https://www.adobe.com/be_en/products/framemaker.html) in Structured mode. In structured mode, you can edit DITA XML documents right from the familiar FrameMaker interface.
-   [Oxygen XML](co_oxygen_xml.html) is an editor especially for DITA. It consists of a few separate packages, with an ever-growing range of products:
    -   [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html) is the complete package, meant for people that do technical writing as well as developing DITA Schemas and transformations.
    -   [Oxygen XML Author](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_author.html) is meant for technical writers. With this package you get a more user-friendly interface and most complicated DITA options are well-hidden in the interface.
    -   [Oxygen XML Web Author](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html) builds on the Oxygen XML Author version, allowing online collaboration between different teams and automatic cloud storage.
    -   [Oxygen XML Developer](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_developer.html) is meant for documentation architects and designers. It is a tool you can use to determine how the documentation in the team should be structured and what the output should look like.

## User-friendly editors

DITA and XML both have a reputation of being complicated, with their tags and attributes. Recently, however, more and more user-friendly editors are being developed.

Some examples:

-   [Fonto Editor](https://www.fontoxml.com/), made in The Netherlands, can be useful for the following scenario:
    1.  Subject Matter Experts \(SME’s\) write reasonable structured topics
    2.  Technical writer improves structure within the Fonto Editor or an alternative DITA-editor
-   [Paligo](http://paligo.net/), made in Sweden
