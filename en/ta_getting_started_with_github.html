# Creating your personal GitHub account

You need to create a personal account when you want to start using GitHub. With the personal account, you can create personal repositories.

1.  Go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) homepage.

2.  Click the **Sign up** button.

3.  Complete all the required fields and then click **Select a plan**.

4.  Choose the individual plan by clicking the **Choose Free** button.

5.  Optionally complete the page with interests.

    You have now created a GitHub account and should have received an email to verify the account.

    If you haven't received an email, click **Resend verification mail** or **Change your email settings**.

6.  Open the email you received from GitHub and click the **Very email address** button.


You have a personal GitHub account where you can save personal repositories.

**Important:** Do not use this personal account to store files from Flow bv. Save all files in a repository on the Flow bv GitHub organization page.

Once you have created a personal account, the Flow bv administrator will make you a member of the Flow bv GitHub organization.
